entities of not visible yet chunks should not be visible to the player

dried rivers look better than road, so change the road to look like that as well

move the remaining sprites in game

changing the view distance should not reset all the chunks


for world gen, let's add an alternative min height so that some mountain areas can go till plains

for world gen, make sure rivers can enter in ocean and also for rivers maybe make the river at the height of the plains? so we have different level rivers
