entities of not visible yet chunks should not be visible to the player

dried rivers look better than road, so change the road to look like that as well

move the remaining sprites in game

changing the view distance should not reset all the chunks


for world gen, make sure rivers can enter in ocean and also for rivers maybe make the river at the height of the plains? so we have different level rivers

for world gen, make the continentalness noise just slightly more vast and maybe mountains more vast. Maybe bias things to increase the chances of getting to bigger biome zones

load only dimensions

shrink UVs extremely slightly for the models

move world, and settings folder out of resources!
