It is the third time I have tried to make Minecraft from scratch.
This time I want to add a lot of harder-to-implement features like transparent blocks, light shadows, and multi-player!

Go check out the videos on [YouTube about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StNAG_tLEoU&list=PLKUl_fMWLdH-0H-tz0S144g5xXliHOIxC&index=4)!
